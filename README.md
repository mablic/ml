# Machine learning aglorithm

Machine learning gradient descent aglorithm.

2 class included into this model:
  a. base class: This is the base class to setup the data structure and the graph.
  b. regression class: This is the class to inheritance the base class and can do linear regression and logistic regression.

## Getting Started

testObj = GradientDescent(your x, your y, your file path)\
testObj.setX(your x needs to include to the model)\
testObj.setY(your y needs to include to the model)\
testObj.computeGradientDescent(your theta, start alpha, nums of running)\
testObj.graphRegression(your x, your output theta)\
